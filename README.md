#What is this thing?

This is a bot that will scrape tweets from politician's twitter feeds and save them to an Arweave Permafeed. A front end is also provided that allows the user to search through previously scraped tweets using keywords to find a politician's stance on something.

#Why did I make it?

I wanted to learn how to develop something for the Arweave blockchain, so I entered their Permafeed competition. See the competition information here - https://gitcoin.co/issue/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/20/3827

#How does it work?

The idea right now is for the Javascript file to handle scraping twitter feeds for new tweets once a day, saving them to the JSON file, and uploading the information to Arweave.
