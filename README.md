#What is this thing?

This repository includes a bot that scrapes twitter for tweets from a list of politicians at a hard coded time interval (currently 1 day). It then records those tweets into a JSON file. This JSON file was then uploaded to Arweave once data was finished recording. A website that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript was also created and is able to be uploaded to the Arweave. The website displays the permanent JSON data from the JSON url on the Arweave. 

Note - The website was not able to be finished in time (the JSON data is unformattted, the intention was for it to be in an HTML table organized by the important keys in the JSON and their values). The search bar was also not able to be created in time for searching for data using ArQL. 

#Why did I make it?

I wanted to learn how to develop something for the Arweave blockchain, so I entered their Permafeed competition. See the competition information here - https://gitcoin.co/issue/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/20/3827
